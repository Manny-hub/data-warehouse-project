# 📊 Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

This project showcases my hands-on experience in building a modern data warehouse using SQL Server, encompassing ETL processes, data modeling, and analytics. It's a comprehensive solution that transforms raw data into actionable insights. The project is inspired by and follows the tutorial from Data With Baraa .

## 🧱 Project Architecture

The data warehouse is structured following the Medallion Architecture, comprising:

* **Bronze Layer**: Ingests raw data from CSV files into SQL Server.
* **Silver Layer**: Processes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization.
* **Gold Layer**: Features business-ready data modeled into a star schema for reporting and analytics.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Key components of the project include:

* **Data Architecture**: Designing a scalable data warehouse using the Medallion Architecture.
* **ETL Pipelines**: Implementing Extract, Transform, Load processes to move data from source systems into the warehouse.
* **Data Modeling**: Creating optimized fact and dimension tables for analytical queries.
* **Analytics & Reporting**: Developing SQL-based reports and dashboards to derive actionable insights.

This project demonstrates proficiency in:

* SQL Development
* Data Engineering
* ETL Pipeline Development
* Data Modeling
* Data Analytics([GitHub][1], [Notion][2])
